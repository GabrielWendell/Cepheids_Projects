## Project Overview
This project aims to explore the universality of the Period-Luminosity 
$(P−L)$ relationship across different galaxies using hierarchical models. By employing the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method with the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm, we analyze the $(P-L)$ relationship parameters in various galactic environments. The goal is to determine whether these parameters remain consistent and potentially universal, thus providing insights into the broader applicability of the $(P−L)$ relationship in cosmic distance measurements.

## Project Flow
