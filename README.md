# Cepheids Projects
Cepheids and RR Lyrae are pulsating stars whose pulsation period is strongly correlated with their mean absolute magnitude. Traditionally, these stars are part of the "distance scale", being crucial to calibrate type Ia supernovae and, therefore, to derive the expansion rate of the universe. The calibration procedure requires that the period-luminosity relation be universal, i.e., valid in all galaxies. In this context, the present repository aims to explore two projects:

1. The integration of statistical methods to obtain the period-luminosity $(P-L)$ relation for multiple galaxies;
2. The integration of machine learning to estimate fundamental parameters for Cepheid and RR Lyrae variables.

## âœ¨ First Project : Hierarchical Models
### Main objective
> Development of an algorithm using Monte Carlo methods via Markov chain with Metropolis-Hasting to analyze the $(P-L)$ relationship in several galaxies, with the aim of determining whether the $(P-L)$ parameters are consistent and potentially universal in different galactic environments.

### Status
- Here you can consult the project [log](https://github.com/GabrielWendell/Cepheids_Projects/blob/main/Project_1/Log.md)

## ðŸŽ‡ Second Project : Neural Networks
### Main objective 
> An artificial Neural Network (ANN) was trained using theoretical pulsation models to predict the fundamental parameters of pulsating stars based on their periods and light curve structures. The aim of this procedure is to increase the accuracy of these estimates by combining theoretical models with observational data.
