## Project Overview

This project aims to explore the the influence of metallicity $\log{\left[\text{O/H}\right]}$ on the Period-Luminosity $(P-L)$ relationship of Cepheids using a variety of statistical and ML methods, including Multiple Linear Regressions and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs).

## Current Stage and Results

As of the latest update, the project is at the stage of **using ML methods to capture nonlinearities in the $(P-L)$ relationship**. The latest results are as follows:

- **Key Findings :** The influence of metallicity is highly nonlinear.

## Next Steps

The upcoming steps in the project include:

- Test the following ML models:
> 1. Ridge and Lasso: include regularization terms to avoid overfitting;
> 2. Random Forest: try to capture non-linearities in metallicity;
> 3. SVR: using non-linear kernels;
> 4. NN: try initially with something like MLP;
> 5. GBM/XBoost: difficulty in data interpretability;
> 6. PCR: combine with PCA before regression.

- Conduct a literature review of related works.

## Future Ideas

Here are some potential ideas to explore in the future:

- **Idea 1:** Try to combine ML methods with other statistical methods to increase the robustness of the work.

### Comments:

**Name**: Wendell  
**Date**: 2024-00-03  

> I decided to create a new project focused only on the analysis of the influence of metallicity on the $(P-L)$ relationship. \
> Initially, I will try to obtain an approximate equation that relates the quantities $M$, $\log{(P)}$ and $\log{\left[\text{OH}\right]}$. \
> Since the MLR and GAM models were not working, I will try an approach using ML from now on.

> What do you think?
