# R11treat.dat
#
# This is a processed and treated version of the Cepheid and redshift datas from R11.
# (Riess et al. 2011 [R11], ApJ, 730, 119, Table 2)
#
# Columns:
#      id: the ID of the cepheid
#     gal: the NGC number of the host galaxy
#       z: redshift of the host galaxy
#      dL: the distance computed via Hubble's law
#       M: abs mags M are computed using M = m + 5*log10(dL/Mpc) + 25
#    Merr: abs mags errs are just the mags m errs
#       m: mags m are computed using m = F160W - 0.41*(V_I)
#    merr: mag errs are just those in the F160W mags
#          (errors in V-I were not given in R11)
#       P: period P is in days (errors in the Period were not given)
#    logP: base-10log of the period for each Cepheid
#  logO_H: this is actually log[O/H], not 12 + log[O/H] as in R11
#    bias: this is the crowding bias *already applied* by R11
#
# Notes:
# - cepheid with id 102255 was excluded since its mag error is 99.0
